[IMDB top 1000 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshitshankhdhar/imdb-dataset-of-top-1000-movies-and-tv-shows)

I wanted to see if I could draw any relations betweeen runtime and rating, or genre and rating.

# Data Analysis Results

Is there a correlation between runtime and rating?
* Yes, but it is much more slight than I would have expected. It seems 150 minutes is roughly the sweet spot. The gradient between 60-150 minutes is very slight. There are plenty of examples live outside of this conclusion, hence the note of it being a slight correlation. Remember correlation is not causation.

Is there a correlation between genre and rating?
* This one is more difficult to tell. On initial glance at the chart it looks like there isn't much of a conclusion to draw. I even mention in my video that there is no correlation. Which based off the dataset is my final conclusion.

I suppose another question that could be asked in the future is how many of a particular genre is within the top 1000. There are certainly more romantic comedies than western comedies. But is it just because there are more of those in general? What percentage of romantic comedies make it into the top 1000 vs western comedies? I may revist this in the future

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* As mentioned in my data analysis. I'd like to revisit my second question with a different dataset
* I think I could better represent that number of genres represented in the second question by making the dot bigger respectively
